# Improved README for Three-Tier Web Application Deployment - MERN Stack WA

This document outlines the deployment and configuration of a three-tier web application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack within an AWS environment. The deployment leverages various tools and services to automate infrastructure provisioning, application deployment, and ongoing operations.

## Key Features:

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Terraform modules automate the provisioning of AWS resources, including VPC, MongoDB instances, NodeJS instances, ASG, and ALB.
- **High Availability (HA)**: MongoDB replica set with automatic failover ensures database resilience. NodeJS applications run on an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) for scalability and fault tolerance.
- **Security**: End-to-end TLS encryption is implemented using ALB and web server configurations (nginx/apache).
- **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipeline automates application build, testing, and deployment processes.
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting systems provide insights into network, servers, ASGs, ALB, and databases.
- **Logging**: PM2 service logs are shipped to CloudWatch for centralized log management.

## Component Breakdown:

- **Terraform**: Provisions AWS infrastructure using modules from the official Terraform AWS repository.
- **Packer**: Creates a custom NodeJS AMI for consistent and automated instance provisioning.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database deployed as a 3-node replica set with authentication and automatic failover.
- **NodeJS**: Backend application server environment using PM2 for process management.
- **ASG**: Auto Scaling Group ensures application scalability based on CPU and memory utilization.
- **ALB**: Application Load Balancer distributes traffic across NodeJS instances and manages TLS termination.
- **AWS Amplify**: Simplifies frontend deployment and hosting.
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Securely stores and retrieves sensitive environment variables for applications.
- **CloudWatch**: Monitors resources and logs, enabling proactive issue identification and alerting.

## Deployment Steps:

1. **Infrastructure Provisioning**: Execute Terraform scripts to create the necessary AWS infrastructure components.
2. **Application Deployment**:
   - **Backend**: Build and deploy NodeJS application to the ASG using a CI/CD pipeline.
   - **Frontend**: Utilize AWS Amplify for frontend deployment.
3. **Configuration**: Configure environment variables, TLS certificates, and monitoring dashboards.
4. **Testing and Validation**: Verify application functionality, performance, and resilience.

## Additional Notes:

- The provided shell scripts `shell-pritunl.sh`, `shell.sh`, and `ami.sh` appear to be related to Pritunl VPN setup, MongoDB installation, and NodeJS environment configuration. These may require further review and integration into the overall deployment process.
- Consider incorporating infrastructure diagrams and detailed configuration instructions for each component to enhance clarity and ease of deployment.
- Ensure the security best practices are followed, such as utilizing IAM roles and least privilege access policies.

## Next Steps:

- Review and refine the deployment process based on specific project requirements.
- Implement automated testing and security scanning as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
- Explore additional observability tools and techniques to gain deeper insights into application performance and user behavior.

By following this guide and adapting it to your specific needs, you can effectively deploy and manage a robust and scalable MERN stack application within an AWS environment.
